This is an as-yet-unfinished PONG clone written in JavaScript for browsers
supporting Canvas.

Its aims are:

* Be JSLint friendly (http://www.jslint.com/)
* Be well tested with YUI Test
* End up with a separate game library for similarly simplistic games

To run the tests, clone the project somewhere and visit test.html in your
browser. Look at the console for test output.
